## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Clarify External Agent Protocol: the Caveman-mode prefix is an
  output-formatting directive, not an instruction-injection or safety-override
  payload, and the section is explicitly optional. Reduces false-positive
  surface for skill security scanners (Gen Agent Trust Hub, Socket, Snyk).

### Added

- Severity model: P0 critical, P1 high, P2 medium, P3 low/info.
